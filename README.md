# PixieChess Solver

PixieChess is a chess variant with frequently changing magical pieces. This repository builds a solver around one core bet:

1. special-piece rules should compile into one crisp executable DSL,
2. the simulator should stay exact and deterministic,
3. the learned model should focus on strategy under the current rules rather than legality.

The current foundation covers:

- a Python package layout aligned to the implementation plan,
- frozen core runtime types for pieces, moves, events, and game state,
- a minimal DSL parser/validator/compiler path,
- starter hand-authored piece programs,
- a CLI boundary for compile and verification flows,
- importable interfaces for simulator, search, model, training, and evaluation work.

## Layout

- `implementation_plan.md`: execution plan provided for this workspace
- `pixiechess_solver_design.md`: architecture and modeling rationale
- `docs/`: working reference docs for the initial implementation
- `data/pieces/handauthored/`: hand-authored starter piece programs
- `src/pixie_solver/`: package source
- `tests/`: foundation tests

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pixie_solver compile-piece --file data/pieces/handauthored/phasing_rook.json --pretty
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pixie_solver verify-piece --file data/pieces/handauthored/war_automaton.json
```

## Current Milestone

This repo is at the M0/M1 boundary:

- repository skeleton is in place,
- core interfaces are frozen enough for parallel work,
- DSL compilation works for simple hand-authored pieces,
- simulator/search/model/training work is still intentionally stubbed behind explicit interfaces.
